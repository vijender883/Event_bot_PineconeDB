# Complete Guide: How to Contribute Using Fork and Pull Requests

Contributing to open-source projects like the RAG Event Bot is a great way to learn and collaborate with other developers. This comprehensive guide will walk you through every step of the process, from setting up your environment to submitting your changes for review.

## What You'll Need Before Starting

- A GitHub account (create one at [github.com](https://github.com) if you don't have one)
- Git installed on your computer
- A code editor (like VS Code, Atom, or any text editor)
- Basic familiarity with terminal/command prompt

## Understanding Key Concepts

Before we start, let's understand some important terms:

- **Fork**: Your personal copy of someone else's repository
- **Clone**: Downloading a repository to your local machine
- **Branch**: A separate line of development (like working on different features separately)
- **Commit**: Saving your changes with a descriptive message
- **Pull Request (PR)**: Requesting to merge your changes into the original project
- **Dev Branch**: The development branch where new features are integrated before going to main

## Step 1: Fork the Repository

Forking creates your own copy of the project that you can freely modify.

1. **Navigate to the main repository** on GitHub (the original project page)
2. **Click the Fork button** in the top-right corner of the page
3. **Select your account** as the destination for the fork
4. **Wait for GitHub to create your fork** (this usually takes a few seconds)

✅ **Success indicator**: You should now see the repository under your GitHub account with "forked from [original-repo]" displayed.

## Step 2: Clone Your Fork to Your Computer

Cloning downloads your forked repository to your local machine so you can work on it.

1. **Go to your forked repository** on GitHub (it should be at `https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/Event_bot_PineconeDB`)
2. **Click the green "Code" button**
3. **Copy the HTTPS URL** (it looks like: `https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/Event_bot_PineconeDB.git`)
4. **Open your terminal or command prompt**
5. **Navigate to where you want to store the project** (e.g., `cd Desktop` or `cd Documents`)
6. **Run the clone command**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/Event_bot_PineconeDB.git
   ```
   Replace `YOUR_USERNAME` with your actual GitHub username.

7. **Enter the project directory**:
   ```bash
   cd Event_bot_PineconeDB
   ```

✅ **Success indicator**: You should see the project files when you run `ls` (Mac/Linux) or `dir` (Windows).

## Step 3: Set Up Connection to Original Repository

This step is crucial for keeping your fork updated and creating PRs to the correct branch.

1. **Add the original repository as "upstream"**:
   ```bash
   git remote add upstream https://github.com/ORIGINAL_OWNER/Event_bot_PineconeDB.git
   ```
   Replace `ORIGINAL_OWNER` with the username of the original repository owner.

2. **Verify your remotes**:
   ```bash
   git remote -v
   ```
   You should see both `origin` (your fork) and `upstream` (original repo).

3. **Fetch the latest changes from upstream**:
   ```bash
   git fetch upstream
   ```

## Step 4: Create and Switch to the Dev Branch

Since we want to create a PR to the 'dev' branch, we need to base our work on it.

1. **Check available branches**:
   ```bash
   git branch -a
   ```

2. **Create a local dev branch based on upstream dev**:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b dev upstream/dev
   ```

3. **Push the dev branch to your fork**:
   ```bash
   git push origin dev
   ```

## Step 5: Create a Feature Branch

Never work directly on the main or dev branch. Always create a separate branch for your changes.

1. **Make sure you're on the dev branch**:
   ```bash
   git checkout dev
   ```

2. **Pull the latest changes**:
   ```bash
   git pull upstream dev
   ```

3. **Create a new feature branch**:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

**Branch naming conventions:**
- For new features: `feature/add-user-authentication`
- For bug fixes: `fix/login-button-error`
- For documentation: `docs/update-readme`
- For improvements: `improve/search-performance`

✅ **Success indicator**: Running `git branch` should show you're on your new feature branch.

## Step 6: Make Your Changes

Now you can start coding! Here are some best practices:

1. **Open the project in your code editor**
2. **Make your changes** focusing on one feature or fix at a time
3. **Test your changes** to make sure they work correctly
4. **Follow the project's coding style** (check if there's a style guide in the repository)

**Important tips:**
- Keep changes focused and related to a single feature or bug fix
- Write clear, readable code with comments where necessary
- Test your changes thoroughly before committing

## Step 7: Stage and Commit Your Changes

Committing saves your changes with a descriptive message.

1. **Check what files you've changed**:
   ```bash
   git status
   ```

2. **Stage your changes** (add them to the commit):
   ```bash
   git add .
   ```
   Or stage specific files: `git add filename.py`

3. **Commit your changes with a clear message**:
   ```bash
   git commit -m "feat: add user authentication system"
   ```

**Commit message conventions:**
- `feat:` for new features
- `fix:` for bug fixes
- `docs:` for documentation changes
- `style:` for formatting changes
- `refactor:` for code refactoring
- `test:` for adding tests

**Example good commit messages:**
- `feat: add password reset functionality`
- `fix: resolve login button not responding`
- `docs: update installation instructions`

## Step 8: Push Your Changes to GitHub

Upload your local changes to your GitHub fork.

```bash
git push origin feature/your-feature-name
```

✅ **Success indicator**: You should see your branch appear on your GitHub fork's page.

## Step 9: Create a Pull Request to Dev Branch

This is where you request to merge your changes into the original project's dev branch.

1. **Go to your forked repository on GitHub**
2. **You should see a yellow banner** saying "feature/your-feature-name had recent pushes" with a "Compare & pull request" button
3. **Click "Compare & pull request"**
4. **IMPORTANT: Change the base branch to 'dev'**
   - Look for dropdowns that say "base: main" 
   - Click on "main" and select "dev" instead
   - Make sure it shows: `base: dev ← compare: feature/your-feature-name`

5. **Fill out the PR form**:
   - **Title**: Clear, descriptive title (e.g., "Add user authentication system")
   - **Description**: Detailed explanation including:
     - What changes you made
     - Why you made them
     - How to test the changes
     - Any relevant issue numbers (e.g., "Fixes #123")

6. **Click "Create pull request"**

## Step 10: What Happens Next

After submitting your PR:

1. **Project maintainers will review** your changes
2. **They may request changes** or ask questions
3. **You can make additional commits** to the same branch to address feedback
4. **Once approved**, your changes will be merged into the dev branch

## Handling Review Feedback

If reviewers request changes:

1. **Make the requested changes** in your local branch
2. **Commit the changes**:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "fix: address review feedback"
   ```
3. **Push the changes**:
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/your-feature-name
   ```

The PR will automatically update with your new commits.

## Keeping Your Fork Updated

Before starting new work, always sync your fork:

1. **Switch to dev branch**:
   ```bash
   git checkout dev
   ```

2. **Pull latest changes from upstream**:
   ```bash
   git pull upstream dev
   ```

3. **Push updates to your fork**:
   ```bash
   git push origin dev
   ```

## Common Issues and Solutions

### Problem: "Permission denied" when pushing
**Solution**: Make sure you're pushing to your fork (`origin`), not the upstream repository.

### Problem: Your branch is behind the upstream dev
**Solution**: 
```bash
git checkout dev
git pull upstream dev
git checkout your-feature-branch
git rebase dev
```

### Problem: Merge conflicts
**Solution**: Git will mark conflicted files. Open them, resolve conflicts, then:
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "resolve merge conflicts"
```

### Problem: Accidentally committed to dev branch
**Solution**: Create a new branch from your current position:
```bash
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
git push origin feature/your-feature-name
```

## Pre-submission Checklist

Before creating your PR, make sure:

- [ ] Your code follows the project's style guidelines
